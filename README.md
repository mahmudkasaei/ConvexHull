# Computing the Convex Hull in 2D...
Here are some algorthms to compute the Convex Hull for a set of points in 2D using Python.

Used algorithms:

**1. Graham Scan.**
  - Also plotting each step of the algorithm.

**2. Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping):**
  - Also plotting each step of the algorithm. (Needs some modifications to plot the comparison with each point...)

### Future work:
Complement with more algorithms, such as Quickhull and Chan's algorithm.
